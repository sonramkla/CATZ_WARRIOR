# OUR STORY
This project began when the owner attended a pet fair. The event back then included a cat beauty contest with various breeds of cats. While watching the cats in competition , the owner saw a booth that belonged to the Homeless Animal Foundation. Their mission is to find new homes for puppies and kittens. He stood there watching them playing happily in the cages.He looked into those existing kittens' and puppies’ eyes and he wished he could help them. They are homeless , they don't have owners to love them. Meanwhile those cats in the contest , they looked so happy. Many cat owners came to support them. The owner asked himself : what if there is a pet community that anyone can join in for fun and can purchase NFT. He can donate a portion of the proceeds to the Homeless Animal Foundation later.That’s why this NFT project needs to make it happen…

1. Educate people on cats and how to take care of them
2. Have community events where pet lovers gather
3. Involve with local NFT artists, (Lets start in Thailand first) and start hosting mini galleries to showcase cat art or any pet related. Catz Warrior brand and get 10% of profits returned to holders in community wallet .
